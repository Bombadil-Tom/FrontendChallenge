This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app) as an interview challenge.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm i`

To install all dependencies. This step is necessary for the following options.

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

Regular development mode. Has all functionalities.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br>
While developing I used [https://airbnb.io/enzyme/](enzyme) to write some tests to ensure stable code when adding or changing features.

### `npm run build`

In case you are planning on rebuilding the project, switch the source path in all JavaScript and css sources by adding a `.` in front of all static sources from: `<script src="/static/js/2.5...` to `<script src="./static/js/2.5...`
